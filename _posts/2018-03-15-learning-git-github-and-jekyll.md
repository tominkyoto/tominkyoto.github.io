I've spent the past two days setting up my Jekyll blog on Github and Git in general. Here are the resources that I've used to study Git, Github and Jekyll:


    - [gitimmersion.com](http://gitimmersion.com/): A great guide that walks you through the fundamentals of Git in over 50 short lessons with example files and enough screenshots to show you the expected result at each step of the process. It takes you a couple of hours to work through all the lessons, so by the time you finish the guide, Git has become a familiar part of your workflow. The only downside is that the commands are for the Linux/Unix bash. So if you're working on a Windows system, you will have to google the Windows equivalent to the bash commands. I may write a Windows cheat sheet for this guide (unless someone has already done that).
    - [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on Github - Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/): A very detailed tutorial on how to create a static Jekyll blog on Github. Just like the above tutorial, this will not only help you create a blog but also immerses you in the Github workflow, so that working with Github will feel natural at the end. What this tutorial doesn't teach is how to setup Jekyll on your own computer. 
    - [Tutorial on how to install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/): The tutorial is detailed and helpful, but the only caveat is that Windows is not officially supported (they do have a 'Jekyll on Windows' page though). 
    - [Practicing Git Basics - The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/practicing-git-basics?ref=lnav): The Odin Project has a great introduction that explains how to clone a Github repository on your local machine, work on it locally and then push your local repo to Github. That's probably the easiest way to manage and work on your Jekyll page. Write new posts with your favourite text editor (in my case Sublime Text 3) and then just use the command line to push your new posts to your Github page.
