Okay, setting up Jekyll and Github pages on windows is kind of a struggel, but at least the basic Jekyll site is up by now. Now, I just have to figure out how to use Git to create my sites locally and push them to my github page from the command line. 

Should be simple, but when all the tutorials are for Linux, you wonder whether you should not finally buy a new computer just for Linux.

Okay, just get this thing done and push it to Github. The experience is what matters.
